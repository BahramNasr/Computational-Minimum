## Buckle up
Ladies and Gentles! right here, right now, in this moment of time, sitting at my desk, pressing the keys on Accu-Type keyboard of my ThinkPad laptop, running Ubuntu Mate, enjoying vintage look of Gnome 2. What I'm going to do is to open-source whatever has been open-sourced to me over past few years, so bring whatever you needed,
open your eyes, clear your mind, put your noise-canceling headphones on, and bear with me to enjoy what I bequeath into your hands, aka "_Computational Minimum_".

## What does "_Computational Minimum_" mean?
It's not a generic term, and I can't give you a dictionary definition. It originated from "_Theoretical Minimum_", a comprehensive entrance exam designed by prominent physicist [Lev Davidovich Landau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lev_Landau), The reason It sticks to my mind was the course taught by a distinguished contemporary physicist [Leonard Susskind](https://theoreticalminimum.com/ "The Theoretical Minimum"), also called  _the **Theoretical Minimum**_.

## Why I'm doing this?
Dunno exactly, I don't want to depict myself as an altruist to cover my egocentric nature, for I despise hypocrisy at cellular level (this is the symptom of the hypocrisy of being not a hypocrite). Trying not so hard to dive deep inside my unconscious to come up with the ultimate answer,  I felt it was nice when somebody did to me,  so I do what they did to me.

## Why I choose this way?
There is a lot of resources on the internet from multi-media to plain text, some of the authors are way better than me in any extent, experience, knowledge, passion, discipline; so what I'm doing in the middle lumbering around?

1) First and foremost, I'm not gonna compete them. I use their works to create a collage suitable for a physics student, to gather, to modify and occasionally to make some improvements over the pre-existing materials.

2) Last but not least, GitBook platform is awesome. having a device with an internet connection, something hard to not to find, everybody can reach a digital copy of it (HTML, PDF, ePub, ... ),  and collaboration on world-scale is possible, everyone can distribute, correct and improve your work.
